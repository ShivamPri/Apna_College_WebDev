    <h1>Iron Man</h1>
    <p>
        Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.

    <h2>Fictional character biography</h2>
    <p>
        Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born on Long Island, New York. As a child, he inherited his family's business, Stark Industries, when his parents were killed in a car crash.[89] Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man.[18][9] The war zone Stark visited was changed retroactively multiple times by different writers to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in which the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. This conflict was the Vietnam War for the first decades of Iron Man's publication history.[90] This was changed to an unnamed Southeast Asian country in the 1990s,[91] and a conflict in the fictional country Siancong was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.[92]

    <h2>
        Technology
    </h2>
    <p>
        Technology and its influence on society are common themes in Iron Man stories,[29][145] and various writers have portrayed him as a technological marvel since his earliest appearances.[146] The character's use of technology, both as a weapons manufacturer and as Iron Man, explores problems that arise from progress and advancement,[147] including misuse of technology and the implications of cybernetics.[148] Iron Man's position within the suit allows for discussion regarding automation versus human oversight of technology,[149] and it reflects the debate on how new technologies are incorporated into public and military use, including the use of exoskeletons and battle suits.[150] These technological themes are explored through a modern lens during the "Extremis" story arc, which incorporates the idea of human enhancement through biotechnology.[151][152]

    <h2>
        Armor
    </h2>
    <p>
        Iron Man does not have any superhuman abilities. Instead, he derives his strength from a powered armor of his own design.[159] The armor is equipped with various weapons, which include "repulsor rays" in each palm that project particle beams as well as a stronger "unibeam" on his chest.[99] As of 2010, Marvel described Iron Man's armor as being able to lift 100 tons and to fly at Mach 8.[99]

        Marvel initially depicted the armor as powered by transistors,[18] but this was replaced with integrated circuits as real-world technology advanced.[160] New designs have further miniaturized the technology, ultimately incorporating nanotechnology.[161] Developments in the armor's design often reflect real-world advances in technology and trends in science fiction.[162] The changing nature of the armor allows artists to make frequent changes to the character's appearance without controversy.[145] Iron Man has also created specialized models for specific purposes,[163] including space armor, stealth armor, and deep sea armor,[164] as well as the Hulkbuster armor to engage in combat with the Hulk.[163]
